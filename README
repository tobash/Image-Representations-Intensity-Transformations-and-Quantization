Image Representations, Intensity Transformations, and Quantization

The main purpose of this project is to get acquainted with NumPy and some image processing
facilities. This project covers:
• Loading grayscale and RGB image representations.
• Displaying figures and images.
• Transforming RGB color images back and forth from the YIQ color space.
• Performing intensity transformations: histogram equalization.
• Performing optimal quantization
